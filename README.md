# Introdiction to Programming

This repository includes the content for the tutorial sessions of the course "Introduction to Programming" at [Independent University, Bangladesh](http://iub.edu.bd). This course will teach students the basics of programming using Python. We will solve a number of problems using Python and learn how to use Python to solve real world problems. Topics range from basic principles of programming like variables, loops, conditional statements, functions, to more advanced topics like data structures and file handeling. It will be a hands on course where students will be encouraged to solve problems on their own. At the end of the course, students will be able to write programs to solve real world problems.

# Course Objectives

- Introduce the students to the basics of problem solving using python.
- Students will be able to understand the scope of programming in solving real world problems.
- Student will learn different building blocks of programming with hands on programming exercises.
- Student will grow in confidence to solve real world problems using programming concepts they have learned.

# Course Outline

- ## Operators, Variables, and Data Types:

  In week 1, we will learn about the basic building blocks of programming. We will learn about console I/O, variables, data types, and operators. We will also learn how to use google colaboratory to write and run python programs. We will solve a number of problems using these concepts to get a better understanding of these concepts.

- ## Boolean and Arithmetic operators:

  In week 2, we will learn about boolean and arithmetic operators. We will learn how to use boolean operators to make decisions in our programs. We will also learn how to use arithmetic operators to perform mathematical operations in our programs. All of these concepts will be used to solve a number of problems which will help students to get a better understanding of these concepts.

- ## Conditional Statements:

  In week 3, we will learn about conditional statements. We will learn how to use basic conditional statements like if, elif, and else to make decisions in our programs. Students will be able to decide which conditional statement to use in a given situation. They will also be able to trace out the alternative conditional paths in a given program. As usual, we will solve a number of problems to get a better understanding of these concepts.

- ## More on Conditional Statements:

  In week 4, we will learn about more advanced conditional statements. We will learn about nested conditional statements and how to use them to make decisions in our programs. We will also learn about the ternary operator and how to use it to make decisions in our programs. We will solve a number of problems to get a better understanding of these concepts.

- ## Loops:

  In week 5, we will learn about loops. We will learn about the different types of loops and how to use them to repeat a block of code in our programs. After this session students will be able to decide when and where to use loops in their programs. We will solve a number of problems to get a better understanding of these concepts.

- ## More on Loops:

  In week 6, we will go a little deeper into loops. We will learn about how to use nested loops in our programs. We will also learn about the break and continue statements and how to use them in our programs. We will solve a number of problems to get a better understanding of these concepts.

- ## Lists and Tuples:

  In week 7, we will learn about lists and tuples. We will learn about the different operations that can be performed on lists and tuples. We will also learn about the different methods that can be used on lists and tuples. We will solve a number of problems to get a better understanding of these concepts.

- ## Functions:
  In week 8, we will learn about functions. We will learn about the advantages of using functions in our programs. We will also learn about the arguments and return values of functions. We will solve a number of problems to get a better understanding of these concepts.

# Prerequisites

As this is an introductory course, no prior programming experience is required. However, students should have a basic understanding of mathematics. Students should be familiar with the following concepts:

- Basic arithmetic operations
- Basic algebra
- Basic geometry
- Basic trigonometry

# Evaluation

Students will be evaluated based on their performance in the following:

- Class participation (50%)
- Assignments (50%)

The grade of this session will contribute 10% to the final grade of the course.

> **Note:** Attendance is mandatory for all classes. Students are expected to attend all classes. If a student misses a class, he/she is expected to inform the instructor in advance. If a student misses a class without informing the instructor, he/she will be marked absent for that class.

# Environment Setup

We will be using [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) to write and run python programs. Google Colaboratory is a free Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup and runs entirely in the cloud. It is a great tool for learning and teaching programming. It is also a great tool for data science and machine learning. You can find more information about Google Colaboratory [here](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb).
