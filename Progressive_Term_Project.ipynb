    "#### **Weekly Task Breakdown:**\n",
    "##### **Task 1:**\n",
    "The first task is to give a name of the software. The name should be unique. We all know name of the software is the first thing a person notices even before using the software. So, create a unique name to the software that you are going to make for the scenarios described in the problem above. \n",
    "\n",
    "*   Create a unique name for the software.\n",
    "*   Think and write down how do you think all the scenarios described in the problem above can be solved using programming knowledge and skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Task 2: Variables and Data Types:**\n",
    "Try to identify the variables and data types that you will need to solve the problem. And then, create a table to show the variables and data types. Each variable should have a unique name. Explain why you have chosen the data type for each variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Task 3: Conditional Statements:**\n",
    "Think about the situations where a customer requested to withdraw or transfer money from his/her account. And then, write down the conditions that you will need to check before processing the request. For example, if a customer requested to withdraw money from his/her account, you will need to check the following conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the customer has enough money in his/her account to withdraw. \n",
    "2. If the transaction amount is less than the transaction limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the customer has enough money and the transaction amount is less than the transaction limit, then you will process the request. Otherwise, you will not process the request. \n",
    "\n",
    "How will you check the conditions? You will use conditional statements. So, write down the conditional statements that you will use to check the conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Task 4: Lists:**\n",
    "If a new customer wants to open a new account, you will need to store the customer’s information in a list. In this task, you will create a 2D list to store the information of the customers. The list will store the following information of the customers:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Customer Name\n",
    "*   Customer Address\n",
    "*   Customer Phone Number\n",
    "*   Customer Email Address\n",
    "*   Customer Account Number\n",
    "*   Customer Account Balance\n",
    "\n",
    "Think why are you using a 2D list to store the information of the customers. Also, think about the data types of the variables that you will use to store the information of the customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Task 5: Loops:**\n",
    "Suppose, you have 100 customers in your bank. And one of your customers requested to withdraw money from his/her account. Now, you will have to search the customer’s account in your list of 100 customers. How will you search the customer’s account? You will use loops. So, write down the loops that you will use to search the customer’s account. Also, the condition that you will use find the appropriate customer’s account. Explain why you have chosen the loop and the condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Task 6: Condition and calculation:**\n",
    "In this task, you will write down the calculations that you will use to process the customer’s request. For example, if a customer requested to withdraw money from his/her account, you will need to calculate the new balance of the customer’s account. So, write down the calculations that you will use to process the following requests:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Open a new account - Customer may deposit a certain amount of money when he/she opens a new account as opening balance othrwise it will be 0.\n",
    "*   Deposit money - Customer may deposit a certain amount of money in his/her account then the new balance will be the old balance plus the deposit amount.\n",
    "*   Withdraw money - Customer may withdraw a certain amount of money from his/her account then the new balance will be the old balance minus the withdraw amount.\n",
    "*   Transfer money - Customer may transfer a certain amount of money to another customer’s account then the new balance of the sender’s account will be the old balance minus the transfer amount and the new balance of the receiver’s account will be the old balance plus the transfer amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, while transferring money, you will need to check the following conditions and based on the conditions, you will do the calculation differently:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   If the customer is transferring money through NPSB (National Payment Switch Bangladesh) then the bank will charge 2.5% of the transfer amount as transaction fee. \n",
    "*   If customer choses to transfer money through BEFTN (Bangladesh Electronic Fund Transfer Network) then no transaction fee will be charged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about the conditions and the calculations that you will use to process the customer’s request. Explain why you have chosen the conditions and the calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Task 7: Problem Solving:**\n",
    "Every customer of the bank has a unique account number. How will you generate the account number for a new customer so that it will be unique? Write down the steps that you will use to generate the account number. Also, explain why you have chosen the steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Task 8: Functions:**\n",
    "In this step, you will convert the steps that you have written in the previous step into functions. The following are the functions that you will create:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   ##### **Function to generate the account number:**\n",
    "    You have written the steps that you will use to generate the account number. Now, you will convert the steps into a function. The function will take the list of the customers as parameters and will return the unique account number for a new customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   ##### **Function to open a new account:**\n",
    "    Write a function that will take the list of the customers as parameter. The function will ask the customer to enter his/her name, address, phone number, email address, and opening balance. Then, the function will generate the account number for the customer and will add the customer’s information to the list of the customers. Finally, the function will return the list of the customers with the new customer’s information.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   ##### **Search function:**\n",
    "    You have written the steps that you will use to search a customer’s account. Now, you will convert the steps into a function. The function will take the list of the customers and the account number as parameters. The function will search the account number in the list of the customers. If the account number is found, the function will return the index of the customer’s information in the list of the customers. Otherwise, the function will return -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   ##### **Function to deposit money:**\n",
    "    Write a function that will take the list of the customers and the account number as parameters. The function will search the account number in the list of the customers using the search function. If the account number is found, the function will ask the customer to enter the deposit amount. Then, the function will calculate the new balance of the customer’s account and will update the customer’s information in the list of the customers. Finally, the function will return the list of the customers with the updated customer’s information. Otherwise, the function will return the list of the customers without any change and will print a message that the account number is not found.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   ##### **Function to withdraw money:**\n",
    "    Write a function that will take the list of the customers and the account number as parameters.

    "\n",
    "*   ##### **Function to transfer money:**\n",
    "    Write a function that will take the list of the customers and the account number as parameters. The function will search the account number in the list of the customers using the search function. If the account number is found, the function will ask the customer to enter the receiver’s account number and the transfer amount. Then, the function will search the receiver’s account number in the list of the customers using the search function. If the receiver’s account number is found, the function will ask the customer to choose the transfer method. If the customer chooses NPSB, the function will calculate the new balance of the sender’s account and the receiver’s account and will update the customer’s information and the receiver’s information in the list of the customers. If the customer chooses BEFTN, the function will calculate the new balance of the sender’s account and the receiver’s account and will update the customer’s information and the receiver’s information in the list of the customers. Finally, the function will return the list of the customers with the updated customer’s information and the receiver’s information. Otherwise, the function will return the list of the customers without any change and will print a message that the account number is not found.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   ##### **Function to Check balance:**\n",
    "    Write a function that will take the list of the customers and the account number as parameters. The function will search the account number in the list of the customers using the search function. If the account number is found, the function will print the customer’s name, address, phone number, email address, account number, and account balance. Otherwise, the function will print a message that the account number is not found. \n",
